# Control-System-For-Lowering-An-Aircraft-Undercarriage
A Keil-based system for lowering aircraft landing gear using an 8051 microcontroller. It includes real-time control, fail-safe mechanisms, and sensor monitoring. Gear deployment is aborted within 10ms if a fault is detected, with simulations for testing and a focus on embedded programming.
